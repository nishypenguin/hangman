# Hangman
## A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned

Hangman is a classic game involving two parties. In this project, the cimputer will choose a word. You have to guess what letters are in the word. If your guess is correct, you grt one step closer to completing the word and beating the comoputer. However, if your guess is wrong, you are closer to being "hanged" and losing the game. 
Good luck!

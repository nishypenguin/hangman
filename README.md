# Hangman
## A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned

Hangman is a classic game involving two parties. In this project, the cimputer will choose a word. You have to guess what letters are in the word. If your guess is correct, you grt one step closer to completing the word and beating the comoputer. However, if your guess is wrong, you are closer to being "hanged" and losing the game. 
Good luck!

I worked on the project in stages. Each milestone corresponds to a stage, and the stages get continually more complex.
I am now up to milestone 4, where we have the defined the class Hangman, its attributes and its methods.

# Hangman
## Basic description of the game

Hangman is a classic game involving two parties. In this project, the computer will choose a word. You have to guess what letters are in the word. If your guess is correct, you get one step closer to completing the word and beating the comoputer. However, if your guess is wrong, you are closer to being "hanged" and losing the game. 
Good luck!

 ## What the project does, the aim of the project, and what you learned

In this project, a function called play_game is called. This function passes through two paramters (the list of words that the computer can choose from and the number of lives the player gets to guess the word) through to the class Hangman once it creates an instance of the class. Once this is done, the code functions appropriately and will run until you win or lose, with an appropriate message showing up.

## Installation instructions
## Usage instructions

If you run the code, the instructions should appear, and the rest will become clear.

## File structure of the project

I worked on the project in stages. Each milestone corresponds to a stage, and the stages get continually more complex.
The final game is on the milestone_5.py file. Where i incoroporate the work from the previous files
